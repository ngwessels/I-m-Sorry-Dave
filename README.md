## Description

_This application will ask user a series of question. First Question is: "Input a Number. Greater than Zero". If the user does type in a negative number or zero it will inform the user to retry. Next Question asks the user to input their name. And the last question is the direction of how it counts numbers. Smallest to Greatest or Greatest to Smallest. Once the user presses the submit button the application will first check to see if there is any input missing, if so it will alert the user. Than it will put every number between 0 and user inputted number into an array. Once complete it will than determine the direction at which it should look at each number. If direction is Smallest to Greatest it will start at 0 and pass it to a function where it will check the number to see if the number contains any "1's, 2's, 3's or is divisible by 3". If they do contain any of those numbers it will input text into a string that matches what the assignment has asked of it. If it doesnt not contain any of those numbers it will display the number. If the Direction is Greatest to Smallest it will start with the user inputted number and work its way down to 0. After each scenario the application will than display the text on the screen. https://ngwessels.github.io/imSorryDave/.
